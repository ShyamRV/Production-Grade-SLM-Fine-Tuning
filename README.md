# 🤖 **Production Grade Custom SLM Fine-Tuning for Robots**

### *Human-like responses. Real emotions. Robot-friendly intelligence.*

---

## 🚀 Overview

**Project NEO** is my ongoing journey to build a custom **Small Language Model (SLM)** that powers my personal robot, **NEO**.
This repository contains the **F1 (First Prototype)** training notebook:
📄 **NEO_F1.ipynb**

The goal of this project is simple but powerful:

> **Give NEO a mind of its own — one that speaks like a human, feels like a companion, and follows real-world tasks like a helpful robot.**

---

## ✨ What NEO Will Be Able To Do

### 🧠 **1. Answer deep questions**

Short, clear, human-like and context-aware replies.

### 😄 **2. Express emotions**

NEO responds with personality —
cute, sarcastic, annoyed, excited, caring — depending on the situation.

### 🏃‍♂️ **3. Understand task commands**

Example:

> *“Go to the kitchen, pick the chips packet, and bring it to me.”*
> The model converts this into structured, step-by-step actions for robotic control.

## 📂 About This Notebook (NEO_F1.ipynb)

The **F1 version** is a lightweight, beginner-friendly fine-tuning pipeline built for **Google Colab (T4 GPU)**.
It includes:

* ✔️ Environment setup
* ✔️ Dataset creation
* ✔️ Emotional + task-based training samples
* ✔️ QLoRA fine-tuning for SLMs
* ✔️ Model evaluation
* ✔️ Exporting and loading the trained model

This version focuses on **simplicity**, **stability**, and **fast iteration** — perfect for building the base before scaling to production.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **HuggingFace Transformers**
* **PEFT (QLoRA)**
* **Python / Google Colab**
* **Small Language Models (Phi, Gemma, TinyLlama, etc.)**

## 📘 Roadmap

### 🔹 **F1 — Prototype (current)**

Basic emotional tuning + task understanding.

### 🔹 F2 — Expanded Dataset

More emotions, personality tuning, and long-context reasoning.

### 🔹 F3 — Robotics API Integration

Model output converted into executable robot instructions.

### 🔹 F4 — Production Pipeline

Optimized weights, on-device inference, safety layers.
